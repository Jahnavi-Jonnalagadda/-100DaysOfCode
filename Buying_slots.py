'''Along one side of a road there is a sequence of vacant plots of land.
Each plot has a different area(non-zero). So, the areas form a sequence
A[1],A[2], ..., A[N].

You want to buy K acres of land to build a house. You want to find a segment of
contigious plots(i.e., a subsection in a sequence) of minimum length whose sum
is exactly K.'''
